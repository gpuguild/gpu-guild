# GPU Guild ⚡️

**Community-driven GPU rental + AI-as-a-Service, powered by solar energy and built in public.**

---

## 🌍 Introduction

GPU Guild is a decentralized platform for GPU rental and AI workloads, designed for transparency, accessibility, and long-term sustainability.

We aim to connect users with GPU power—starting with RTX 4090s and expanding to AI inference tools like Stable Diffusion, LLaMA, and Whisper—running on a solar-powered, community-funded infrastructure.

## 🎯 Vision

- Democratize access to GPU compute power.
- Empower AI builders with open and verifiable tools.
- Fuel the network via a token launched on [pump.fun](https://pump.fun).
- Build a sustainable future for compute: green, affordable, community-owned.
